Hi, I'm Lorenzo!
I'm an indie game developer passionate about creating unique, fun, and meaningful gaming experiences.
I love building games with Godot, experimenting with new mechanics, and constantly learning new things.
Here you'll find my projects, prototypes, and experiments — feel free to explore!

Always excited to connect and collaborate. 🚀
